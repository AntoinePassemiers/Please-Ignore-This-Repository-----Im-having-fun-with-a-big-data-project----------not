\chapter{Conclusion}

During this project, a distributed version of the RLS algorithm
has been implemented using both Kafka distributed messaging server
and Kafka streaming API.
The algorithm is both scalable with respect to the number of models
and output variables.
It has also been observed that the speed of convergence is affected
by the value of the global optimal, and that higher forgetting
factors yield better performance.

As future work, a dynamic forgetting factor~\cite{johnstone1982exponential} could be considered
in order to guarantee both high convergence speed and high
convergence rate.
