\chapter{scalability}

Scalability is the ability of a big data system to process
an increasing amount of incoming data by having recourse
to an increasing amount of resources. It can be measured
by the scaleup, the ratio between the amount of data processed
by the model with two different amount of resources but
while being run for the same amount of time.

TODO: sub-linear scaleup?
